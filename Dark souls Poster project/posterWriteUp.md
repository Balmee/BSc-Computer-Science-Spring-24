# [Slave Knight Gale Poster]

23046621 BSc Computer Science Spring '24

# Project Description

I have created an interactive poster which was inspired by the videogame DLC boss fight of Gale from Darksouls 3, by FromSoftware. Here there are two pages that can be accessed showing two key story points of the game itself, the afore mentioned boss fight as well as the end of the game wherein multiple choices are presented.

#### Design Ideas and Inspirations

Here I have implemented both the week 5 html ideas taught with some others I found online. The poster shows a description of the mentioned character, as well as two videos of the character which can be paused, played and switched between via button prompts, as well as a volume slider. I have also implemented a embedded html link to another page which allows for the second half of this project wherein the password function is used, taught in week 4 via an example piece of code. Here I have altered it so two other possible outcomes aside from the failed to occur; this being a audio file or video file being played. For my first page, with Gale, I used the html file rather than the sketch file to code, as it gave me higher access of control to the posters layout, allowing the video to appear above the text and allowing for ease of control for the button and slider layouts throughout. At this part I got most my pointers online using  Stackoverflow for slider customisation and then p5js references combined with and geeksforgeeks which taught me about the use of id and making the video its own entity, as well as allowing me to understand how to use html effectively, leaning i can still use the p5js code within the body of the html file via writting script. For the design of the text in the css file i used heavily my own worked example taught also in week 5, altering and adding parts to accodate the use of the buttons and text added.

#### Design Criteria and Outcome

The product is a infomational poster showing the lore of the character Gale and his intro boss fight cutscene, as well as its second phase. when it comes to forfilling the design criteria, I decided to use the 30 second clip I captured on xbox when playing through the game earlier this year, organising a poster around it which gave interactive control. This is where the idea to use the slider for volume came from, as well as buttons for play and pause functionality. I wanted to show dynamic interaction by switching the video which I did accompish, however this only left two interactive prompts of differing layout. So this is why I came to the idea of using an embedded link which opens to the second page, which involves the password function upgraded from class having three outcomes. 
I thought the Dark souls series fit this layout of the two pages as it is a story of cycles and so the ability to return from page one and two via a clickable link in the form of the 'Ringed city' and 'Kiln' felt very fitting to use. The second pages use of two correct answers to the password show the two main endings which I think were conveyed fittingly to how both end their playthoughs. Visually, thee ability to make the web page black for both strongly conveys the feeling of the dark souls franchise and so I do see it fittingly in this creative project, also the use of the switch video button being called Hollowfy, fits within the lore of the character and to why that cutscene exists as he goes into his second phase- and so although a bit confusing to people who havent played the games I believe the use of it would intruige the user into clicking, suprising them with this cutscene like a player in the game. I would so in creating this project I wanted to convey a narrative poster which had interactivety to which I think have acheived successfully.
